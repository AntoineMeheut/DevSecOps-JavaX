# ArcherySec-Zed
  This guide helps you set up archerysec, a tool that helps developers and pentesters to perform scans and manage vulnerabilities, and run a OWASP-**Z**ed **A**ttack **P**roxy (**ZAP**) to scan security vulnerabilities in your application. ZAP is run on the target url where our application is running and Archerysec will import the scanned results from ZAP and display the detected vulnerabilities in our application.
